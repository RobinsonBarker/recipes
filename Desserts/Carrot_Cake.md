## Ingredients

- 2 cups AP flour
- 2 tsps baking soda
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon + more to taste
- 0.25 tsp ground cardamom
- freshly grated nutmeg to taste
- ground cloves to taste
- 1.25 cups melted butter (can use oil instead, but cake won't be as moist)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup lightly packed brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract + more to taste
- 4 large eggs
- 3 cups peeled carrots

- Buttercream frosting optional

Makes 22-24 cupcakes. Cut ingredients in half to make 12, but add 1 extra egg for moist cake (so 3 eggs total instead of 2), and really pay attention to taste of batter for spices.
